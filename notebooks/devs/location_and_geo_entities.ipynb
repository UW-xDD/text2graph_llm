In this area the conglomerate to sandstone ratio is about three. The rounded cobbles of the conglomerate are composed mainly of argillite and plutonic rock. The matrix of the conglomerate is sandstone. The sandstone is characterized by an abundance of chlorite-bearing phyllite fragments, and it generally contains less than 15 per~ent quartz (Lathram and others, 1965). Carbonized wood fragments are common in the sandstone. The 2000-foot-thick Kootznahoo sequence unconformably overlies strongly deformed beds of the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous Seymour Canal Formation and the Devonian and Mississippian Cannery Formation. It is overlain by basaltic and andesitic flows of the Eocene and Oligocene Admiralty Island Volcanics and was intruded by felsic to mafic dikes and sills. Fossil leaves suggest a Paleocene age for the Kootznahoo in this area (Wolfe, in Lathram and others, 1965).\n",

      "Input: Additional petrographic logs in Hood (2000) show that planktic foraminifera decrease in abundance from the underlying Otaraoa Formation into Tikorangi Formation, and then show an overall increase up-core, reaching a maximum in upper sections where bioclastic contents are low. The more siliciclastic/matrix-rich beds are enriched in planktic foraminifera. Echinoderms generally follow a reverse trend to planktic foraminifera, decreasing up-core and being more abundant in bioclastic-rich upper beds.A similar trend occurs for bivalves and benthic foraminifera, and possibly also calcareous red algae. Spicules and spines remain persistent minor components throughout the formation. Unidentified skeletal fragments tend to follow the planktic foraminiferal trend, increasing up-core and being more prevalent in siliciclastic matrix-rich units. Interpreted siliciclastic compositions for Waihapa-5 show no major variation upcore, although a decrease in quartz and feldspar content and an increase in pyrite occurs on entering the basal Tikorangi Formation.

The proposed fossils of Cubozoa, Coronate, Semaeostomae and Narcomedusae (referred respectively as ‘cormr’, ‘cubomr’, ‘narmr’, ‘semamr’ in Fig. 9 and Appends. 1–2) from the Middle Cambrian Marjum Formation (Cartwright et al., 2007) were listed into the new character matrix together with Kuanchuanpu medusozoans. All 104 characters have equal weight, 8 of them are constant, 26 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative, and the rest 70 characters are parsimony-informative. The unweighted analysis of the data matrix in PAUP analysis yielded 2628 trees (tree length (TL) = 184, consistency index (CI) = 0.6250, rescaled consistency index (RC) = 0.4732).

The Eagle Ford Formation does show a subtle change in mineralogy, texture and PSD that may signify the change from TST to HST. Although this core does not include turbiditic sands, the presence of grading beds, the greater influx of plagioclase, quartz and calcite and the reduction in bioclasts and peloids does suggest that area may have seen the distal toe sets of turbiditic sands at the transition from TST to HST.\n",

      "Input: Extensive stromatolitic carbonate platforms developed during and after the Palaeoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which records a significant increase of oxygen in the atmosphere and oceans. Stromatolites link biological and non-biological processes through their microscopic organo-sedimentary structures that have the potential to provide information about microbial and diagenetic processes that operate during their formation. This study aims to document the mineralogy and organic geochemistry of microscopic diagenetic structures in the exceptionally-preserved late Palaeoproterozoic stromatolitic dolomite from the McLeary Formation of the Belcher Islands, in Nunavut, Canada. This is done to test the hypothesis that chemically oscillating reactions can influence the formation of diagenetic spheroids such as rosettes, granules, concretions, and botryoids; these reactions occur over short timescales during diagenesis, i.e. before the lithification of the sediment. Decimetresize columnar stromatolites from the McLeary Formation contain centimetre-size pyrite concretions, which themselves also contain framboids. Inside rounded, black chert concretions and coarse quartz granules, there are filamentous microfossils composed of organic matter partly replaced by pyrite. These observations are consistent with post-depositional oxidation–reduction reactions involving organic matter and sulphate. In comparison, decimetre-size tabular bioherms of millimetre-to-centimetre size stromatolite columns contain microscopic dolomitic carbonate structures including circularly-concentric rosettes, zoned dolomite rhombs, and cavity structures of rounded equidistant laminations, all of which are layered with organic matter.\n",

      "The first positive evidences for Silurian rocks in the Parnaiba Basin were a palynological study by Miiller (1962), and a specimen of Arthrophycus sp. tentatively identified by Moore (1963) in the basal part of the Serra Grande Formation (Small, 1914 sensu Kegel, 1953). Arthrophycus was at the time known in Brazil only from Silurian beds in the Amazonas Basin (Derby, 1878; Clarke, 1899a). Brito (1967c) described Silurian acritarchs from what he thought to be the Itaim Member (later Jaicds and Itaim formations) of the Pimenteira Formation. Lange (1972) considered the Serra Grande Formation to be contemporaneous with the Trombetas Formation in the Amazonas Basin. Besides, he doubted that the acritarchs described by Brito (1967c) really came from the Itaim. Investigations by Daemon (1976) and Grahn (1991) indicate the presence of Silurian spores and acritarchs in the Tiangua Formation, defined by Rodrigues (1967) as a member of the Serra Grande Formation that overlies the Ipu and underlies the Jaic6s Formation.\n",
